// The plugin: the screen's camera as a camera of its device in Home Assistant (esp_video_camera, plugin.yaml). The core
// shows its dot while Home Assistant takes pictures (it listens to ts_camera itself, plugin API 0.17), so this plugin
// draws nothing of its own for that.
// And, only while a person switches it on (the setting "Camera light level and motion", off by default), the room's
// light level and motion, worked out on the screen from the camera's frames: no picture leaves the screen for them. The
// camera hands its processed frames to the frame hub (frame_hub.h), which hands them on to this plugin on the camera's
// own task while sensing is on (RGB565, or the part Video's YUV420); the plugin reads a coarse grid of them through the
// frame reader (frame_reader.h) and gives the results to the main loop. While it runs it tells the core (tessera::capturing), so
// the dot shows then too; with the setting "Camera motion wakes the screen" (off by default) motion wakes the screen.
